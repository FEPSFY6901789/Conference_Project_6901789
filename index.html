    <p class="w3-justify">Commercial flight has monopolised the skies ever since the very first commercial flight on January 1, 1914, when pilot Tony Jannus flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. Since this day, commercial flight has ‘taken off’ into what we know today. With airports and airlines, it is the only widespread method for air travel that majority of people can afford. And since 1914 planes and airports have enhanced the experience of flying commercial, improving the safety of the passengers onboard whilst making sure to keep comfort in mind. However, despite best efforts there are still instances of flight accidents or flight delays due to primarily human interaction (or a lack of human resources in the case of flight cancellations/delays. So, this begs the question; can a reduction of human interaction improve the safety of the individual? To answer that question, we need to investigate the pros and cons of manned aircrafts and what aspects of commercial flight can be automated to tackle any challenges. </p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">To get a proper understanding of flight automation we must get an understanding of what ‘automation’ is. Mid 1900s, Delmar S. Harder, the vice president for manufacturing at the ford motor company in the US, introduced the new word, ‘automation’, this term was introduced to describe a production setup at the company’s factory, where multiple automated machines were interconnected into a single, cohesive process​ (Hayes, 2015)​  The use of automated operations in manufacturing processes was already established before the 1940s. Throughout the inter-war period, automation expanded across the United States, Europe, and Britain, particularly in high-output industries such as textiles, cigarette manufacturing, and chemicals. However, after the war, automation's effects impacting both individual industrial workers and the nation's psychosocial fabric sparked widespread debate and concern. Automation is closely related to the modern need for sustainable development in the 21st century ​(Kongoli, 2012)​. A core principle of sustainability, “Doing More with Less,” aligns closely with the goals of automation. By delegating routine tasks to machines, automation not only boosts productivity and product quality to levels beyond human capacity but also frees up space, time, and energy. This shift allows humans to focus on new, non-routine challenges, such as developing innovative and more advanced technologies. </p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">What Are The Dangers Of Manned Flights</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">Put simply, manned flights aren’t dangerous. In 2023 there was one accident for every 1.26 million flights ​(IATA, 2024)​ . The main difficulties that are involved with manned aircrafts is staffing and flight delays/cancellation. For example, in 2023, easyJet had 1.69% of flights cancelled and 34.89% of flights delayed ​(Flightright, 2024)​ commonly these delays are caused by employee strikes or simple a lack of available staff. Employees may feel that striking is their only recourse for various reasons, such as poor working conditions, inadequate pay, or disputes regarding their employment contracts. Regardless of the specific issue, when employees are dissatisfied, striking can become a way for them to voice their concerns and frustrations. And whilst this is a good thing for the workers, it can be of great inconvenience for any passengers.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">Is there any future for automation in flights? </h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">Automation plays a significant role in commercial aviation. While it has brought numerous benefits to the field, the growth of automated systems has taken over many routine pilot tasks. Today, computers, equipped with advanced automatic flight management systems, primarily control most modern aircraft. (Bliss, T. J.& Wise, A. J(2023)) Pilots are unlikely to rely on a system they don’t fully trust. To advance automation, it’s essential to shift the narrative that humans and machines are inherently at odds. The perception that machines dominate pilots or guide the aircraft toward disaster has contributed to automation’s negative reputation. For successful integration, automation must be seen as a collaborative tool, enhancing rather than undermining human control. Similarly that pilots are unlikely to rely on a system they don’t fully trust its likely regular passengers will be hesitant in accepting a fully automated system aswell 

he passenger aviation industry has widely adopted electronic automation both on the ground and in the air. This includes systems like automated check-in and arrival processes, air traffic control automation, and extensive onboard automation, particularly through autopilot technology. It is likely that automation has reached the end of the road in the case of airlines however may see slight changes in the future only when we are ready for it.</p>
