    <p class="w3-justify">Commercial flight has monopolised the skies ever since the very first commercial flight on January 1, 1914, when pilot Tony Jannus flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. Since this day, commercial flight has ‘taken off’ into what we know today. With airports and airlines, it is the only widespread method for air travel that majority of people can afford. And since 1914 planes and airports have enhanced the experience of flying commercial, improving the safety of the passengers onboard whilst making sure to keep comfort in mind. However, despite best efforts there are still instances of flight accidents or flight delays due to primarily human interaction (or a lack of human resources in the case of flight cancellations/delays. So, this begs the question; can a reduction of human interaction improve the safety of the individual? To answer that question, we need to investigate the pros and cons of manned aircrafts and what aspects of commercial flight can be automated to tackle any challenges. </p>

    <p class="w3-justify">To get a proper understanding of flight automation we must get an understanding of what ‘automation’ is. Mid 1900s, Delmar S. Harder, the vice president for manufacturing at the ford motor company in the US, introduced the new word, ‘automation’, this term was introduced to describe a production setup at the company’s factory, where multiple automated machines were interconnected into a single, cohesive process​ (Hayes, 2015)​  The use of automated operations in manufacturing processes was already established before the 1940s. Throughout the inter-war period, automation expanded across the United States, Europe, and Britain, particularly in high-output industries such as textiles, cigarette manufacturing, and chemicals. However, after the war, automation's effects impacting both individual industrial workers and the nation's psychosocial fabric sparked widespread debate and concern. Automation is closely related to the modern need for sustainable development in the 21st century ​(Kongoli, 2012)​. A core principle of sustainability, “Doing More with Less,” aligns closely with the goals of automation. By delegating routine tasks to machines, automation not only boosts productivity and product quality to levels beyond human capacity but also frees up space, time, and energy. This shift allows humans to focus on new, non-routine challenges, such as developing innovative and more advanced technologies. </p>
